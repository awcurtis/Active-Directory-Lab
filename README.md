This is a test script for learning purposes and shouldn't be implemented directly in a production environment. You would have to modify the execution policy to even do so.

Be sure to execute from the directory that the script is located within and ensure Users.txt is located in the same directory as well.
By default, it will create a new organizational unit of _SALES.
Current functionality doesn't handle duplicate names, so some errors will be seen when the script is run and already existing account names are encountered.
